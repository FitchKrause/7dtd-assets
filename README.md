# 7 Days to Die assets

Collection of 7 Days to Die vanilla assets extracted from the `Data` and `7DaysToDie_Data` folders.

Game versions from the latest to `alpha9` can be downloaded from Steam by modifying the `BETA` option.

Game versions prior to `alpha9` can be found on [archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=7+Days+To+Die+Alpha+Game+%28Spiel%29&sort=titleSorter).

The `PRE-ALPHA` version of the game has not been found yet.

## Item Icons

From the game version `alpha11` you can find all the icons in the `ItemIcons` folder. For previous versions only a "bundle" has been extracted containing all the icon in a single file `Items3DPreviewAtlas.png`.

Item icons have been extracted using the tool [AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio).

## XML files

The `Config` folder contains the original vanilla `.xml` files found in the installed game folder.

These can be modified to change the game settings, make balancements or to build mods.

For game versions prior to `alpha10` the only configuration file is `recipes.xml`.
